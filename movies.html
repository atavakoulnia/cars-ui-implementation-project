            <p>
            Farewell, my gallant friend, loyal
            as an old dog, you've waited for me
            outside so many doors, always responsive
            to the first turn of my key.
            You were my freedom. I could always leave.
            You never failed me, not even in snow.
            On unfamiliar roads
            In winter I could travel safe and warmly,
            your solid frame enclosed me
            like a parental hug, and I was soothed
            by the voice of your radio.
            Now I am helpless. Cannot run away.
            And standing at a windy bus stop
            have to say: You were my good-times;
            a piece of genuine, twenty-first century magic âˆ’
            my scratched old five-door Vauxhall automatic!
