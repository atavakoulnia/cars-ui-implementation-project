# CS290 Course Project

In this project, you need to use HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build a simple website and publish it online. You can build a personal website for yourself, or a website of a small business or organization like a farm, a restaurant, a park, a hotel, a baseball club, or a website of some tutorials, showing skills that you have expertise in and want to share with others. You have a lot of freedom to determine the details of your website as long as you meet the requirements.  The theme doesn’t need to be real. Be creative! You will have three weeks (w6-w8) to work on this project. 


## Requirements:

- The webpages should be presentable as a whole; the interface should be user friendly (text should be easy to read).
- The website should contain pictures and/or videos, and they should be presentable as well (placed in a proper place, easy to see, have proper size and resolution).
- Website has 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages; the homepage and subpages have a horizontal menu that leads to the other pages. This means 4 total pages will be required.
- The homepage has picture carousel animation (slideshow effect, for example, pictures in this page http://oregonstateparks.org/ (Links to an external site.)). This needs to autoscroll and have forward and back buttons.
- Have a scroll box in one page. You can put text only or text with pictures inside the scroll box.  The scroll box should have something like a scroll bar to allow users rolling it up and down. Some students have scroll boxes show up after submitting the form, if this is the case make sure you add a comment to the grading TA letting them know.
- One page has a form either submit via get or post (enter the email and subscribe, a short survey, etc.)  You can set it to be submitted to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangluy/tools/class-content/form_tests/check_request.phpLinks to an external site. or your own link as long as it is working. Forms that do not actually transmit the data somewhere will not receive full marks.
- One page has unordered HTML list with several entries. The horizontal menu does not count for this requirement.
- There is one button to download files (map to the farm, menu in the restaurant, a personal CV, etc.) The downloaded file can either open in the browser or download to the local computer.
- There is a link that you can click and leads to outside webpages (LinkedIn, Yelp, email, etc.)
- You are allowed to add other features not listed above to your website as long as they are functional and serve some purpose in your website.
- You should use at least HTML/CSS and JavaScript in your project.
 
## Things to keep in mind:

- You need to search online or read books to learn the skills you need for this project by yourself. You can post questions on Piazza if you couldn’t solve some technical difficulty after some research. Check out the resource link page on Canvas for more information (Start Here - Useful Links) and also W3School for short tutorials (https://www.w3schools.com/ (Links to an external site.)).  You are allowed to use other existing APIs (like Bootstrap for CSS) for your project.  If you are not sure about certain resources, ask us on Piazza.
- You are not permitted to use frameworks such as Angular and React.
- There are a lot of website templates online. You can learn some features or settings from these templates, but you can’t copy the whole templates and use it as your own project.
- You need to design your page first before you actually start coding. Remember that your pages should be presentable.  It doesn't need to look like a professional website to get the full grade, but when we look at the pages, we should be able to tell that you have put some efforts to design your pages.
- You can build a simple website that meets the requirement first, and add more features later if you have time. 
- If you use pictures/videos from other resources (not owned by you), please cite the resources to avoid any copyright issue.
- The content of your website doesn’t matter. We will not grade based on the content (for example, we won’t look at your CV attached in your website to see whether it is a good one).  So just put something meaningful there, and if you want to make your website real, you can update the content later.
- You should spend less time designing and making things pretty and spend more time on implementing interesting code. You can challenge yourself to implement some more advanced features, such as a form that needs to submit somewhere, a picture with a border, some backend admin features controls.
- Many website functions rely on the database access which will be taught in CS340. We will touch it a little bit in week 9.  We won’t require you to implement the database related functions in this project.  Try to use all the skills you learned so far in this course to build your website.  If your website only uses HTML/CSS without JavaScript code, your project will be deduct 10% points.
- For a few of you who take this course together with CS340, you are allowed to use part of your code from that course project for this project, but don't submit an identical project for both courses.
